Hi, my name is Kenny Chan. I am a Software Engineer/Founder at Zenlab in Singapore.

I started building things when I was 10 and have been loving it ever since. I enjoy building software from the back to the front-end. Recently I have been working a lots with Ruby on Rails and AngularJS projects. You can see some of my personal projects on my Github profile.

I founded Zenlab LLP in July 2012, where I build a team of 4 guys working on several Ruby on Rails projects. Some of the projects that we are proud of includes yeshelper.com(A clone of homejoy), education-garden.com.sg(A management system for a Singapore based education center) and taratreasures.com(A ecommerce website in Australia). The experiences gain from starting these projects taught me a lot especially starting, failing fast and building a team to execute that.

I graduated from National University of Singapore in July 2012 with my degree in Computer Engineering. While there, I interned at 2 startups in Silicon Valley, VSee Inc, and Space Machine Inc and studied in Stanford University under the NOC(NUS overseas college) program.

Currently I am working on ways to improve the bookkeeping process, starting to write a technical blog on things that I am building and starting to contribute back to the community.

If you are interested in reaching out to me you can email me.
