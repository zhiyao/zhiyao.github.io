# Writing Writing Writing... I am not fond of it

Writing has always not been my forte. But I am here to change that starting from today. Even if no one reads this or my writing is so bad, I would start writing ideas and thoughts at least 1 time a week to begin.

So to begin I went to research on why I should start writing. Here are some of the list of reasons.

###1. Focus and reorganise your thoughts
 Before beginning any projects, it pays to start writing about it first. Writing helps me focus on what matters and organise your thoughts in a more coherent manner. Benjamin Franklin once said, "Either write something worth reading or do something worth writing"

###2. Build an audience and spread your ideas.
 When you write and share your writing, you are putting a piece of yourself out there. Writing actually create an opportunity for you to connect with a stranger.

###3. Absorb knowledge better
"好记性不如烂笔头", a chinese proverbs that translate to "the faintest ink is better than the best memory". We all absorb knowledge better when we write notes. Writing makes you aware of your content.  

###4. Its free
We live in a age where publishing and distributing that article is free of charge. Unlike 20 years ago, publishing anything meant going to a publisher and it get distributed as an article in a magazine or newspaper.
